## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Validate Leaderboard functionality that it displays top scores and data persists
- Verify core game functionality ‚Äî word scrambling, bonus calculations, and reset behavior
- Confirm negative test cases (invalid input, no word entered) are handled gracefully
- Evaluate UI responsiveness across various screen sizes and environments
- Apply risk-based testing to prioritize high impact areas
- Document identified defects and provide evidence

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- Testing on Latest Google Chrome browser
- Word Scrambling and validation logic
- Scoring and Hint deduction logic
- Reset Game and Leaderboard state management
- UI and Input validation (buttons, responsiveness, text input)
- User input error feedback and message display

**Out of Scope:**

- Cross-browser testing (e.g., Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Performance testing under load
- Mobile device and Responsive design testing

### Tools & Resources
